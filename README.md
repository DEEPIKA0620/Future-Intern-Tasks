Task 1: Data cleaning 
     PROJECT : Students performance Analysis
         This project analyzes and predicts student performance using Data cleaning ,visualization,and machine learning 
      # Task performed 
          * cleaned data and handled outliers 
          * Explored unique values in categorical columns
          * Visualized data using seaborn(pie chart with labels, scatter plots, count plot)
          * calculated average scores for subjects 
          * Built a RandomForestRegressor model for prediction
      # output 
          * visual insights on students performance
          * predictions using a trained ML model
