Task 1: Data cleaning 
     PROJECT : Students performance Analysis in Exam
     
This project analyzes and predicts student performance using Data cleaning ,visualization,and machine learning 
      # Task performed 
          * cleaned data and handled outliers 
          * Explored unique values in categorical columns
          * Visualized data using seaborn(pie chart with labels, scatter plots, count plot)
          * calculated average scores for subjects 
          * Built a RandomForestRegressor model for prediction
      # output 
          * visual insights on students performance
          * predictions using a trained ML model
           
      
Task 2: Calculate Summary Statistics
     PROJECT : Titanic Summary Statistics
     
This project calculate the summary statistics of Titanic Dataset
              * Mean
              * Median
              * Mode
              * Standard Deviation of The Dataset

              
Task 3: Visualization Of Data
     PROJECT : Netflix Movies vs TV Shows â€“ Data Visualization Project

In this project, I explored the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using Python to understand global content trends.
I performed the following key steps:

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning
â€“ Removed missing or inconsistent entries to ensure data quality.
â€“ Focused on relevant columns like type, country, release_year, and rating.

ðŸ”¹ Data Exploration
â€“ Analyzed the distribution of Movies vs TV Shows.
â€“ Explored how content varies across countries, ratings, and years.

ðŸ”¹ Visualization
â€“ Created clear and insightful bar charts and histograms using Seaborn and Matplotlib:
* Content type comparison (Movies vs TV Shows)
* Top countries by content volume
* Distribution of content release years
* Ratings distribution across Netflix titles

ðŸ”§ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Š This project helped me practice EDA and visualize real-world streaming data.
